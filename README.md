# Reads-Profiler

ReadsProfiler is a university project aimed at developing a digital platform that functions as an online library. It enables users to search for specific book titles or authors, browse through various genres and subgenres, and download books that suit their interests.

The platform is powered by a locally hosted database containing a selection of mock book entries used for testing and demonstration purposes. Users can not only explore the available content but also download documents directly to their personal computers.

The goal is to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience, allowing readers to easily find and access content without encountering technical or usability barriers. Key advantages of the project include efficient access to information and intuitive navigation, supported by an algorithm designed to deliver clear and concise results for every available action at any given moment.
